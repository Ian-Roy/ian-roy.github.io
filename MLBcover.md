Hiring Manager, Defensive Security  
Major League Baseball  

Dear Hiring Manager,

I’m writing to express my interest in the **Senior Manager, Defensive Security** role at Major League Baseball. I’m currently a DevOps Engineer with the Cleveland Guardians, where I’ve led integrations with the MLB Ballpark application and worked closely with our ticketing products. Over the last few years, I’ve had opportunities to focus on anti-abuse efforts around season tickets, and the opportunity to work on those challenges at the league level is exactly the direction I want my career to take.

As a computer scientist with a strong foundation in mathematics and cryptography, I have gradually become the security conscience on most engineering teams I’ve joined. Even when my job title did not say “security” directly, I found myself driving efforts to implement **vulnerability scanning** in application code as well as third-party libraries. I often work with my team to prioritize and remediate security issues. I personally find joy in the combination of automation and protection, wiring security checks into CI/CD pipelines so that secure practices are the default, not an afterthought. Shifting the detection of security issues earlier in the software development lifecycle helps developers better understand security while reducing the chances that a critical issue is released. 

One project I am particularly proud of is the **MLB Ballpark app integration** for season ticket members used by the Cleveland Guardians. On this project, I served as both the lead engineer and the project manager. I coordinated requirements and timelines while navigating the MLB vendor program. The result was a robust, well-tested application that met both functional and security expectations for a fan-facing platform.

Before moving into baseball, I spent several years building data collection tools in adversarial environments. This experience gave me a deep understanding of **modern bot detection techniques** such as reCAPTCHA, canvas fingerprinting, and behavioral signals such as mouse and keyboard patterns. Today, I am much more interested in using that knowledge on the defensive side, evaluating anti-bot and anti-fraud controls that hold up against real attackers, especially in high-value contexts like ticketing and streaming.

Over the years, I’ve taken on increasing leadership responsibilities, mentoring, teaching, and answering questions from teammates. I also continue to advocate for pull-request-based code reviews and secure coding practices. I am comfortable translating between engineers, IT operations, and non-technical stakeholders, and I am looking to take the next step into a formal **defensive security leadership** role where I can combine that experience with MLB’s broader mandate to protect its platforms.

I would welcome the chance to talk about my background in more detail. I am very interested in being a part of MLB’s next-generation defensive strategy, particularly around anti-bot protections. Thank you for taking the time to consider me; I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,  
Ian Roy
