# Ian Roy  

## Summary
Senior DevOps and software engineer with 10 years of experience building and operating production systems, CI/CD pipelines, and data platforms. I specialize in security-conscious automation, authentication, and large-scale web integrations, including work on applications integrated with the MLB Ballpark platform for the Cleveland Guardians. I frequently serve as a security champion on engineering teams, participating in audits, vulnerability remediation, and secure coding efforts, while mentoring developers and analysts.

## Security & DevSecOps Experience
- Acted as a **security champion** across multiple engineering teams, helping drive a “security is everyone’s responsibility” culture.
- Participated in numerous **security audits** (internal and external) of closed-source and open-source code, and implemented remediation for identified issues.
- Implemented **vulnerability scanning in Datadog** for production applications, tuning alerts and collaborating with developers to triage and remediate findings.
- Implemented and maintained **GitHub Dependabot** to track and remediate vulnerabilities in Node.js and other third-party dependencies.
- Strong practical knowledge of the **OWASP Top 10**; implemented fixes for common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., injection, XSS, authentication/authorization issues, sensitive data exposure) during security reviews and audits.
- Extensive background building **web automation and scraping tools** in highly adversarial environments, gaining a deep understanding of modern **bot detection and mitigation techniques** (e.g., reCAPTCHA, canvas fingerprinting, behavioral analysis of keyboard/mouse interactions).
- Experience with **authentication and IAM** through implementation of Microsoft Entra (Azure AD) for secure access to applications and services.
- Academic background in **cryptography and mathematics**, including research projects on RSA encryption and ElGamal digital signatures.
